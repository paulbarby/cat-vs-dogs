# Cat vs. Dogs - Web-Based Maze Editor

A simple, browser-based level editor designed specifically for creating and modifying maze layouts for the "Cat vs. Dogs" game. This tool allows for visual editing of the maze grid and exports the map data directly into the 2D JavaScript array format required by the game logic (`game.js`).

The editor runs entirely in the browser using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## AI Assistance

This web-based editor application was created with the assistance of AI. The core structure, functionality, and code implementation for `editor.html`, `editor.style.css`, and `editor.js` were generated using prompts provided to **Google AI Studio** ([aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/)), leveraging the capabilities of the **Gemini 1.5 Pro** model to translate the detailed requirements into functional code. The process involved iterative prompting for feature implementation, formatting, and debugging.
