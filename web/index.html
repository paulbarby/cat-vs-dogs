                    <p><strong>Development Notice:</strong> This game was created as a learning experiment to explore AI-assisted development. It was built through collaboration with Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model, where I provided the design and requirements while the AI generated and refined the code. While fully playable, it serves primarily as a test project to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of AI-assisted game development.</p>

                <p>Experience a fun twist on the classic arcade game! Instead of Pac-Man, you're a crafty Cat (`🐈`) navigating a maze. Your goal? Eat all the delicious cat food (`🐾`) scattered throughout.</p>
                <p>But watch out! A pack of determined Dogs (`🐕`, `🐩`, `🦮`, `🐕‍🦺`) are hot on your tail, acting as the ever-persistent ghosts.</p>

                <h2>How to Play</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Move:</strong> Use the <strong>Arrow Keys</strong> (↑ ↓ ← →) to guide the cat through the maze.</li>
                    <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Eat all the small dots (`🐾`) on the screen to complete the level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid:</strong> Don't let the dogs catch you!</li>
                    <li><strong>Power Up!:</strong> Grab the fish (`🐟`) to gain temporary power. While powered up, the dogs become vulnerable (`🦴`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Turn the Tables:</strong> Catch vulnerable dogs to send them back to the central pound and score big bonus points!</li>
                    <li><strong>Levels & Lives:</strong> Survive through 5 levels of increasing difficulty. You start with 5 lives. Lose them all, and it's game over!</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Development Note</h2>
                <p>This game was developed as a test/learning project through collaboration between myself and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model. The development process followed these steps:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>I provided detailed specifications and requirements for the game mechanics, features, and design</li>
                    <li>Gemini generated the initial code implementation</li>
                    <li>Through iterative feedback and testing, we refined the code, fixed bugs, and added features</li>
                    <li>Key improvements included implementing A* pathfinding for dog AI, proper collision detection, and screen wrapping</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This project demonstrates the potential of AI-assisted coding while serving as a learning exercise in game development.</p>
